# TimelineApp

## TODO

This app is an experiment of Netlify's resources with a very simple purpose: allow people to create and edit two-level timelines and share it with people, if they want.

It is running on [https://timeline.rdnz.dev](https://timeline.rdnz.dev), and there are some things that need more work:

- Authentication:
  - Login with Google
  - Login with GitHub
- Improve feedback to users:
  - Success
  - Errors
  - Loading
- Pages:
  - Account settings page

---

You can run it locally anyway:

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
